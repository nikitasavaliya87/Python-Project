# Turtle Crossing Game with Python

## Overview
This Python code is an implementation of a simple and addictive game called "Turtle Crossing." In this game, the player controls a turtle character to cross a busy road while avoiding oncoming cars. The game keeps track of the player's score and difficulty level.

## Game Interface
The game interface is displayed on a 600x600 window. The player uses the "Up" arrow key to move the turtle character up. The objective is to safely cross the road without getting hit by oncoming cars.

## Modules
This code is organized into three custom modules:
- `player`: Defines the Player class for the turtle character.
- `car_manager`: Manages the creation and movement of cars.
- `scoreboard`: Manages the player's score and displays it on the screen.

## Game Features
- The game continuously generates cars that move from the right side of the screen to the left.
- The player's score increases each time they successfully cross the road.
- If the player collides with a car, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.

## Custom Modules
The code uses custom modules to organize different game elements, making it more maintainable and extensible. The modules define the behaviors and interactions of the player, cars, and the game's scoreboard.

## Challenge and Fun
This code provides a simple yet enjoyable game that offers an opportunity to learn and explore game development with Python. It can be extended with additional features, levels, and challenges to make it even more engaging.

Have fun playing and improving your Turtle Crossing skills!
