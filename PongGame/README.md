# Pong Game with Python and Turtle

## Overview
This Python code is an implementation of the classic game Pong using the Turtle graphics library. It provides a simple two-player Pong game where each player controls a paddle to bounce a ball back and forth. The game tracks player scores and continues until one player reaches a winning score.

## Game Interface
The game features two paddles and a ball on a black background. The right player uses the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys to control their paddle, while the left player uses the "W" and "S" keys. The game detects ball collisions with the paddles, the top and bottom walls, and tracks when a player scores a point.

## Required Modules
- `Turtle`: Used for creating the game's graphics and interface.
- `paddle`: A custom module that defines the Paddle class.
- `ball`: A custom module that defines the Ball class.
- `scoreboard`: A custom module that manages and displays player scores.

## Game Features
- The paddles can move up and down to hit the ball.
- The game continues until a player reaches a winning score.
- Scores are displayed on the screen.

## Custom Modules
This code uses custom modules to organize and manage different aspects of the game, such as the paddles, ball, and scoreboard, making it more maintainable and extensible.

## Enjoy Playing
This code provides a fun implementation of the Pong game that can be a great starting point for learning and exploring game development with Python. Feel free to customize and extend the code to add more features or create your own games.

Enjoy playing and learning with the Pong Game!
