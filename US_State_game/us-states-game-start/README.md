# U.S. States Game with Python Turtle

## Overview
This Python code is a simple interactive game that quizzes users about U.S. states. It uses the Turtle graphics library to display a map of the United States and prompts the user to guess the names of the states. The user can exit the game at any time and will be presented with a list of states they haven't guessed correctly.

## Game Interface
The game starts by displaying a map of the United States with all the states initially blank. The user is prompted to guess the names of the states, and their answers are not case-sensitive. The user can exit the game by typing "Exit" as their answer.

## Usage
1. The user guesses a state's name, and the program checks if it's correct. If correct, the state's name is revealed on the map.
2. If the user types "Exit," the game ends, and a list of unguessed states is displayed.
3. The list of unguessed states is also saved to a CSV file named "State_to_learn.csv" for future reference.

## Required Libraries
- `turtle`: Used for creating the graphical interface.
- `pandas`: Used for reading data from a CSV file.

## Data
The game relies on a CSV file, "50_states.csv," which contains the names and coordinates of all 50 U.S. states.

## User Interaction
The game is interactive, allowing users to click on the map to guess the states' names and exit the game when they choose to do so.

## Creative Learning
This code provides an engaging way to learn about U.S. states' names and locations on the map. Users can modify and extend the code to create their educational games, quizzes, or interactive applications using the Turtle graphics library.

Enjoy playing and learning with the U.S. States Game!
