# Pomodoro Timer with Python and Tkinter

## Overview
This Python code implements a Pomodoro timer application using the Tkinter library. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that helps users stay focused by breaking work into intervals with short breaks. This application provides a graphical interface to set work, short break, and long break intervals.

## Features
- Set work, short break, and long break intervals.
- Start and reset the timer.
- Track the number of work intervals completed.
- Visual tomato timer display with countdown.

## Constants
The code defines various constants, including colors, font names, and time intervals for work, short breaks, and long breaks.

## Timer Mechanism
The `start_timer` function manages the countdown timer for work and break intervals. It determines the type of interval based on the number of work sessions completed and updates the timer display accordingly.

## Countdown Mechanism
The `count_down` function handles the countdown logic, converting time in seconds to minutes and seconds and updating the timer display. It starts the timer and displays a checkmark for completed work intervals.

## UI Setup
The user interface (UI) is set up using Tkinter. It includes labels for the timer, a canvas for displaying a tomato image, buttons to start and reset the timer, and a label to display completed work sessions.

## Usage
- Set the work, short break, and long break intervals.
- Click the "Start" button to begin the Pomodoro timer.
- Click the "Reset" button to stop and reset the timer.
- Completed work intervals are marked with checkmarks.

## Customization
